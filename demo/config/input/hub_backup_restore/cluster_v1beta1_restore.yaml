# apply this resource to restore all backup data, including managed clusters activation data 
# cleanupBeforeRestore - required, asks to clean up cluster before applying restore
# valid options : 
# CleanupRestored - clean up only resources created by a previous acm restore
# CleanupAll - clean up all resources defined by the acm backups IncludedResources spec
#              even if they were not created as a result of a restore operation
#              Use this option with caution as this could cleanup resources on the hub
#              created by the user, that should be kept even if they are not in the restored resources
# None : don't clean up anything, just apply the restore
